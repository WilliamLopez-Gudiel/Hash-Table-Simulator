I created two different types of hash maps (hash tables that “map” unique keys to values). One map (ThreeTenHashTable1) will use open addressing with linear probing and the other (ThreeTenHashTable2) will use separate chaining. Both maps will do the same things (i.e. they will have the same operations, such as put(), get(), rehash(), etc.), but they will do them in different ways (probing vs chaining).
